## How the Backgrounds Work

Each section has:
1. **Base background image** (the photo you provide)
2. **Opacity setting** (makes it subtle, not overwhelming)
3. **Gradient overlay** (ensures text is readable)

### Current Opacity Levels:
- **Hero:** 50% opacity (fairly visible)
- **About:** 30% opacity (subtle)
- **Platforms:** 25% opacity (very subtle)
- **Gallery:** 20% opacity (atmospheric)
- **Booking:** 40% opacity (moderate)

### To Adjust Opacity:
If you want any background more or less visible, I can adjust these values in the CSS.
